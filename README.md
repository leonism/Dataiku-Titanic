# Kaggle's  Titanic Challenge on Dataiku!

**RMS  _Titanic_**  was a British  [passenger liner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superliner_(passenger_ship) "Superliner (passenger ship)")  operated by the  [White Star Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Star_Line "White Star Line")  that  [sank in the North Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic "Sinking of the RMS Titanic")  in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an  [iceberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg "Iceberg")  during her  [maiden voyage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_voyage "Maiden voyage")  from  [Southampton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton "Southampton")  to  [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). Of the  [estimated 2,224 passengers and crew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic#Casualties_and_survivors "Sinking of the RMS Titanic")  aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial  [marine disasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_maritime_disasters_in_the_20th_century#Peacetime "List of maritime disasters in the 20th century").  [RMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Mail_Ship "Royal Mail Ship")  _Titanic_  was the  [largest ship afloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_world%27s_longest_ships "List of world's longest ships")  at the time she entered service and was the second of three  [_Olympic_-class ocean liners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-class_ocean_liner "Olympic-class ocean liner")  operated by the White Star Line. She was built by the  [Harland and Wolff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harland_and_Wolff "Harland and Wolff")  shipyard in  [Belfast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast "Belfast").  [Thomas Andrews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Andrews_(shipbuilder) "Thomas Andrews (shipbuilder)"), chief naval architect of the shipyard at the time, died in the disaster.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-4)

_Titanic_  was under the command of Capt.  [Edward Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Smith_(sea_captain) "Edward Smith (sea captain)"), who also  [went down with the ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship "The captain goes down with the ship"). The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from  [Great Britain and Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"),  [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia")  and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. A high-powered  [radiotelegraph transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy "Wireless telegraphy")  was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-auto-5)  Although  _Titanic_  had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, it only carried enough  [lifeboats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(shipboard) "Lifeboat (shipboard)")  for 1,178 people—about half the number on board, and one third of her total capacity—due to the maritime safety regulations of those days. The ship carried 16 lifeboat  [davits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davit "Davit")  which could lower three lifeboats each, for a total of 48 boats. However,  _Titanic_  carried only a total of  [20 lifeboats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboats_of_the_RMS_Titanic "Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic"), four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch during the sinking.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-6)

After leaving Southampton on 10 April 1912,  _Titanic_  called at  [Cherbourg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherbourg "Cherbourg")  in France and Queenstown (now  [Cobh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobh "Cobh")) in Ireland, before heading west to New York.[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-7)  On 14 April, four days into the crossing and about 375 miles (600 km) south of  [Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island) "Newfoundland (island)"), she hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time. The collision caused the  [hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft) "Hull (watercraft)")  plates to buckle inwards along her  [starboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard "Port and starboard")  (right) side and opened five of her sixteen watertight  [compartments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartment_(ship) "Compartment (ship)")  to the sea; she could only survive four flooding. Meanwhile, passengers and some crew members were evacuated in lifeboats, many of which were launched only partially loaded. A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "[women and children first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_children_first "Women and children first")" protocol for loading lifeboats.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-8)  At 2:20 a.m., she broke apart and foundered with well over one thousand people still aboard. Just under two hours after  _Titanic_  sank, the Cunard liner  [RMS _Carpathia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Carpathia "RMS Carpathia")  arrived and brought aboard an estimated 705 survivors.

The disaster was met with worldwide shock and outrage at the huge loss of life, as well as the regulatory and operational failures that led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to  [major improvements in maritime safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changes_in_safety_practices_after_the_sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic "Changes in safety practices after the sinking of the RMS Titanic"). One of their most important legacies was the establishment of the  [International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Convention_for_the_Safety_of_Life_at_Sea "International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea")  (SOLAS) in 1914, which still governs maritime safety. Several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-9)
So be sure to match those above mentioned technical requirements. Fell free to fork, download and enhance the Notebooks files. This is a work in progress, and I wouldn't consider this a finish project.
