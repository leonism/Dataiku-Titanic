# Kaggle's  Titanic Challenge on Dataiku!

# Introduction

_Titanic_  was under the command of Capt.  [Edward Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Smith_(sea_captain) "Edward Smith (sea captain)"), who also  [went down with the ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship "The captain goes down with the ship"). The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from  [Great Britain and Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"),  [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia")  and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. 

# Installation
On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with downloaded from Kaggle. Installation pretty straight forward. Simply download the whole set as a single project as a ZIP files, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue. You'll be needing one proper installation of Dataiku version 7, PgSQL (due some of the project was running on top of an SQL), running on top of whatever Operating System you're most familar with.
