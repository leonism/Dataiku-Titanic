# Kaggle's  Titanic Challenge on Dataiku!

_Titanic_  was under the command of Capt.  [Edward Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Smith_(sea_captain) "Edward Smith (sea captain)"), who also  [went down with the ship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship "The captain goes down with the ship"). The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from  [Great Britain and Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland"),  [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia "Scandinavia")  and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States. The first-class accommodation was designed to be the pinnacle of comfort and luxury, with a gymnasium, swimming pool, libraries, high-class restaurants and opulent cabins. 

A high-powered  [radiotelegraph transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_telegraphy "Wireless telegraphy")  was available for sending passenger "marconigrams" and for the ship's operational use.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-auto-5)  Although  _Titanic_  had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, it only carried enough  [lifeboats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboat_(shipboard) "Lifeboat (shipboard)")  for 1,178 people—about half the number on board, and one third of her total capacity—due to the maritime safety regulations of those days. The ship carried 16 lifeboat  [davits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davit "Davit")  which could lower three lifeboats each, for a total of 48 boats. However,  _Titanic_  carried only a total of  [20 lifeboats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifeboats_of_the_RMS_Titanic "Lifeboats of the RMS Titanic"), four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch during the sinking.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Titanic#cite_note-6)

# Installation
On this repository, you may find my personal projects related to Machine Learning, EDA, Python Jupyter Notebook and couple of Visualization based on the Dataiku Platform exported standard files. Most of the datasets I've been working with downloaded from Kaggle. Installation pretty straight forward. Simply download the whole set as a single project as a ZIP files, everything have been flattened out with plain text files, and no SQL dump was involved, so there wouldn't be any missing system dependencies issue. You'll be needing one proper installation of Dataiku version 7, PgSQL (due some of the project was running on top of an SQL), running on top of whatever Operating System you're most familar with.

# Disclaimer
And please remember, as this is only a weekend pet project, which I'm doing them for my personal interest only.
